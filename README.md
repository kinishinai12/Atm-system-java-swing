before you run the system, 


-> create a folder in your desktop then name it "ATM CARD".


->File cardCreated = new File("C:\\Users\\junie\\Desktop\\ATM CARD\\"+cardNumber+".txt");
  FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("C:\\Users\\junie\\Desktop\\ATM CARD\\"+cardNumber+".txt");   //change the paths in confirm.java
  





ask me if there was a problem on the system or message me if you have complain about my system.. thankyou!
